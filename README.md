Hello! I am a visual designer from Texas who desires to create thoughtful print and digital designs for clients, friends and family. I have worked throughout my career to develop a versatile set of skills – logo design, illustration, print layout, web design, animation, video editing – and I'm always learning more. Right now, I am focused on learning javascript, mastering web animation and harnessing augmented reality to create more engaging experiences online and in the real world.
